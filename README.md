### Terrain predicted meteorological variance. 

**Paul Dunn**

#### Executive summary
Meteorological data such as precipitation and temperature can be modeled predictively based on time series methods. However, localized data will vary based on topography. 
#### Rationale
Localized, site specific meteorological information is useful for several operational purposes for response, defense, and agriculture among other purposes. It is impossible to have weather stations at all locations, but there are methods for spatial predictive modeling to estimate spatiotemporal results for areas of interest (AOI.)

#### Research Question
Predict site specifc temperature and precipitation based on historical time-series data.
#### Data Sources
Meteostat.
#### Methodology
Time series mothods still being vetted. Spatial linear regression prediction based on a digital elevation model (DEM.)
#### Results
Time series preidiction not ideal for these data using current methods. 
#### Next steps
Need to fine tune time series model for final prediction step.
